Axxl-Db
=======
Axxl Db is an update database version of UDB plus a lot more new additions.
The purpose is to create the perfect role play enviroment as closer as possible to blizzlike behavior.

Current work is based on checking all:
- spawns
- waypoints
- equipments
- spells/abilities used by the npc/creature

I am looking for redoing:
- Orgrimmar
- Stormwind
- Darnassus
- Exodar
- Ironforge
- Undercity
- Thunder Bluff
- Silvermoon

Next step:
- all towns/camps from azeroth
- all towns/camps/cities outlands
- all towns/camps/cities northrend
